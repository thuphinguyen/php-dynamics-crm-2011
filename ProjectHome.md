This project is a PHP library that can be used to access Microsoft Dymanics CRM 2011 servers for integration and reporting purposes.

This is not a replacement for the Dynamics software, nor it is a user interface; however, it could be used as the basis of a user interface or some kind of reporting tool.

The primary purpose of this project is to allow other PHP software (e.g. reporting tools, task management tools etc.) access to data stored in Dynamics to allow for integration between the CRM and any other tools used by the company.
